# Assisted Image Labeler
A WIP personal tool for cleaning my lora datasets. Supports a few different models for tagging, will probably support rephrasing with llms eventually. Most model support is through apis at the moment because I don't have access to a gpu right now and it's minimal effort.
# Install
1. `pip install -r requirements`
2. `python labeler.py`
